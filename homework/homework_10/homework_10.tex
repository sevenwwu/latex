\begin{problem}
	Consider the function $f\colon [0,2\pi]\to [-1,1]$ given by $f(x) = \cos x$. Determine each of the following sets.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $f\left([0,\pi]\right)$
		\item $f\left(\{\pi\}\right)$
		\item $f\left((0,\frac{\pi}{2})\right)$
		\item $f\left((0,\pi)\right)$
		\item $f^{-1}\left(\{-1,1\}\right) = \{0,\pi,2\pi\}$
		\item $f^{-1}\left(\{0,1\}\right)$
		\item $f^{-1}\left((-1,0)\right)$
		\item $f^{-1}\left(\{0\}\right)$
	\end{enumerate}

        \item $[-1,1]$
        \item $-1$
        \item $(0,1)$
        \item $(-1,1)$
        \item $\{0,\pi,2\pi\}$
        \item $\{\frac{\pi}{2},\pi,\frac{3\pi}{2},2\pi\}$

\begin{problem}
	Consider $f\colon A\to B$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Prove $f$ is injective if and only if $X = f^{-1}(f(X))$ for all $X\subseteq A$.
		\item Prove $f$ is surjective if and only if $Y=f(f^{-1}(Y))$ for all $Y\subseteq B$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        \phantom{ }

        \noindent Suppose some function $f$ is injective with a range of $B'$.

        \noindent Then, for all $n,m \in A$ where $n \neq m$, $f(n) \neq f(m)$.

        \noindent Additionally, the inverse relation $f^{-1}$ can be restricted
        to the domain $B'$ to yield the function $f^{-1}_\text{res}$. 
        
        \noindent This inverse function is trivial injective because
        that's what it means to be a function.
        
        \noindent Consider each element $x \in X$. Because its unique, by definition
        of a set, $f(x)$ is also unique.
