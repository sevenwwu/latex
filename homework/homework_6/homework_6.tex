For these problems, you should justify your answers. You do not need to provide a rigorous mathematical proof, but rather an informal argument.

\begin{problem}
	Give a combinatorial proof of the fact that ${n\choose k}{k\choose m} = {n\choose m}{n-m\choose k-m}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{soln}
    \phantom{ }

	\noindent Suppose $C \subseteq B \subseteq A$, where $|A| = n$, $|B| = k$, and $|C| = m$.
    Each combination is equal to another if both $B$ and $C$ have the exact same elements.

    \phantom{ }

    \noindent The left side counts each unique combination of $B$ and $C$ by first filling $B$ with $k$ 
    elements from $n$, then picking $m$ elements from $B$ to fill $C$. 

    \phantom{ }

    \noindent Let's try counting this another way. Suppose we first pick the elements that should
    fill $C$, so ${n \choose m}$. Then, because $B$ has a cardinality $k$ and is a subset of $C$,
    we should first, fill $B$ with all elements from $C$, then pick the remaining $k - m$ elements
    from the rest of $A$. $A$ has $n - m$ remaining elements. So, ${n-m \choose k-m}$. Thus, the total
    count will be ${n\choose m}{n-m\choose k-m}$. 

    \phantom{ }

    \noindent It has been shown that you can count the same set of combinations of $B$ and $C$
    two different ways. Thus, ${n\choose k}{k\choose m} = {n\choose m}{n-m\choose k-m}$.


    % \noindent $\displaystyle\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\frac{k!}{m!(k-m)!} = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\frac{(n-m)!}{(k-m)!(n-m-k+m)!}$

    % \noindent $\displaystyle=\frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\frac{(n-m)!}{(k-m)!(n-k)!}$

    % \noindent $\displaystyle=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\frac{}{m!(k-m)!}$

    % \noindent $\displaystyle=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\frac{}{m!(k-m)!} \cdot \frac{k!}{k!}$

    % \noindent $\displaystyle=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\frac{k!}{m!(k-m)!}$

\end{soln}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}
	Give a combinatorial proof of the fact that $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^n2^k{n\choose k} = 3^n$.
	Then, give a proof using the binomial theorem.
\end{problem}

\begin{soln}
    \phantom{ }

    \textbf{Combinatorial Proof:}

    \begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{0em}
        % \noindent The left side the equality is counting the number of different ways we can 
        % put $n$ elements into $2$ exclusive subsets $A$ and $B$, where we do not have to use all $n$ elements.
        % For example with $1$ element, we can put it in into $A$ or $B$. With $2$ elements $x$ and $y$,
        % we can put them both in $A$, both in $B$, $x$ in $A$ and $y$ in $B$, or $x$ in $B$ and $y$ in $A$.

        % \phantom{ }

        % \noindent The right side of the equality is counting
        % the number of different ways we can put $n$ objects into $3$ bins. We have three choices
        % for each element, with a unique thing to count every time we move an element between bins.

        % \phantom{ }

        % \noindent Now, this is actually really what we're doing on the left side. For each element
        % it is either being picked to be placed in subset $A$ or $B$, or it is being left out of both.
        % This left out of both can simply be subset $C$. $A \cup B \cup C$ contain all elements, and
        % $A \cap B = \varnothing$, $B \cap C = \varnothing$, $A \cap C = \varnothing$. This is
        % exactly what we are doing on the right side. 

        \noindent Suppose we have set $S$ of cardinality $n$ and want to know how many
        different ways we can make $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$,
        where $A \cap B = \varnothing$.

        \phantom{ }

        \noindent One way we can count this is by counting the number of ways for some $k$ elements of $S$
        to be placed in $A$ or $B$. Then summing the total from each value of $k$ where $0 \leq k \leq n$. 
        $2^k$ can be used to count how many different ways we can put $k$ elements into $A$ or $B$ (but not both).
        This is because for each of the $k$ elements, there are $2$ choices. The multiplication principle
        says that each diverging choice should be multiplied to count the total number of variations.
        In symbols, this is $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^n2^k{n\choose k}$. 

        \phantom{ }

        \noindent Another way we can count this is by saying that there are
        really $3$ disjoint (and exhaustive) subsets. $A$, $B$, and $S - (A \cup
        B)$. Because they are all disjoint and all subsets, we can count the
        number of unique combinations of $A$ and $B$ by using the multiplication
        principle again. For each element in $S$, we have $3$ choices, to place
        it in $A$, $B$, or neither. In symbols, this is $3^n$. 

        \phantom{ }

        \noindent It has been shown that you can count the same set of combinations of $A$ and $B$
        two different ways. Thus, $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^n2^k{n\choose k} = 3^n$
    \end{adjustwidth}

    \phantom{ }

    \textbf{Binomial Theorem Proof:}

    \begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{0em}
        $\displaystyle\sum_{k = 0}^{n} {n \choose k} x^{n-k}y^k = (x + y)^n$

        \phantom{ }

        \noindent Looking at the given equality, $\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^n2^k{n\choose k}$ is
        very similar to the binomial theorem's left side. 
        
        \noindent Setting $x = 1$ and $y = 2$, the binomial theorem shows that:

        \noindent $\displaystyle\sum_{k = 0}^{n} 2^k {n \choose k} = (1 + 2)^n = 3^n$.
    \end{adjustwidth}
