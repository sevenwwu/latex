\begin{document}

Prove the following propositions. Format your proof so each step of the proof is on its own line; each line should still be a complete sentence.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
	Suppose $a,b,p\in\Z$ and $p$ is prime.
	Prove that if $p|ab$, then $p|a$ or $p|b$.
	(Suggestion: Use the Proposition on page 152.)
\end{proposition}

\begin{prf}
	\phantom{ }

	Suppose $p\nmid a$ and $p \nmid b$.

	Then $p$ is not a prime factor of $a$ or $b$.

	$ab$ is simply adding the multiplicities of each prime factor
	of $a$ and of $b$ together. 
	
	$p$'s multiplicity in $a$ is $0$, same with $b$. 
	
	Because $0 + 0 = 0$, $p$'s multiplicity in $ab$ is $0$.

	So, $p \nmid ab$. 
\end{prf}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
	If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets, then $A\cup(B\cap C) = (A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)$.
	
\end{proposition}

\begin{prf}
	\phantom{ }

	Suppose $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets.

	Consider the following sequence of equalities:

	\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{0em}
		$A \cup (B \cap C) = \{x : (x \in A) \cup (B \cap C)\}$ \hfill (definition of set)

		$=\{x : (x \in A)\} \cup \{x: x \in B \land x \in C\}$ \hfill (definition of intersection)

		$=\{x : (x \in A) \lor (x \in B \land x \in C)\}$ \hfill (definition of union)

		$=\{x : (x \in A \lor x \in B) \land (x \in A \lor x \in C)\}$ \hfill (logical `or' distributive property)
	
		$=\{x : (x \in A \lor x \in B)\} \cap \{x: (x \in A \lor x \in C)\}$ \hfill (definition of intersection)
		
		$=(A \cup B) \cap \{x: (x \in A \lor x \in C)\}$ \hfill (definition of union)

		$=(A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ \hfill (definition of union)
	
	\end{adjustwidth}

\end{prf}

\begin{problem}
	Determine whether the following statement is true.
	If it is true, prove it; if it is false, give a disproof.
	\begin{center}
		If $X\subseteq A\cup B$, then $X\subseteq A$ or $X\subseteq B$.
	\end{center}
\end{problem}

\begin{soln}
	\phantom{ }

	Suppose $A = \{1\}$, $B = \{2\}$, and $X = \{1,2\}$.

	Then $A \cup B = \{1, 2\}$.

	So, $X = A \cup B$.

	Thus, $X \subseteq A \cup B$.

	But also, $X \nsubseteq A$ and $X \nsubseteq B$.
