\begin{document}

Prove the following propositions. Format your proof so each step of the proof is on its own line; each line should still be a complete sentence. Below, I have entered a nonsensical proof as a model.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
	Suppose $a,b,c\in\Z$.
	If $a^2+b^2=c^2$, then $a$ or $b$ is even.
\end{proposition}

\begin{prf}
	Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and that $x>y$.
	
	Then, $x-y>0$.
	
	Let $\varepsilon\in(0,x-y)$.
	
	Then we have $x-y\geq \varepsilon$.

    \jeff{The above is an example of how to format your proof with one sentence on each line. Please do this when you submit your proofs!}
\end{prf}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
	Suppose $x,y\in\Z$.
	If $x+y$ is even, then $x$ and $y$ have the same parity.
\end{proposition}

\begin{prf}
	
\end{prf}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proposition}
	If $a\equiv b\pmod n$, then $\gcd(a,n) = \gcd(b,n)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{prf}
