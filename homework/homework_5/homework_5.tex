For these problems, you should justify your answers. You do not need to provide a rigorous mathematical proof, but rather an informal argument.

\begin{problem}
	The English alphabet has 26 letters and 5 vowels. How many lists of 8 English letters are there that...
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item contain no vowels, if letters can be repeated?
		\item contain no vowels, if letters cannot be repeated?
		\item start with a vowel, if letters can be repeated?
		\item start with a vowel, if letters cannot be repeated?
		\item contain at least one vowel, if letters can be repeated?
		\item contain exactly one vowel, if letters cannot be repeated?
		\item start with \textsc{z} and contain at least one vowel, if letters cannot be repeated?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(26-5)^8 = 37,822,859,361$

        \item $\displaystyle\frac{(26-5)!}{(26-5-8)!} = 8,204,716,800$

        \item $\displaystyle5 \cdot \frac{(26-1)!}{(26-1-7)!} = 12,113,640,000$

		\item $26^8 - (26-5)^8 = 171,004,205,215$

\begin{problem}
	How many hands from a standard 52-card deck contain a full house? (A full house means three cards of one value and two cards of a second value.)
\end{problem}

\begin{soln}
	\phantom{ }

	\noindent $\text{select the two ranks}\cdot \text{pick 3 of the 4 available cards}\cdot\text{pick 2 of the available 4 cards}$

	\noindent *note that ``order'' matters, as we need to pick one rank for three, and the other for two 

    $\displaystyle\frac{13!}{(13-2)!} \cdot {4 \choose 3} \cdot {4 \choose 2} = 1872$

\begin{problem}
	A classroom has 2 rows of 8 desks. There are 14 students, 5 of whom always sit in the front row, and 4 of whom always sit in the back row. In how many ways can the students be seated?
\end{problem}

\begin{soln}
	\phantom{ }
	
	\noindent $\text{pick 5 seats in the front} \cdot \text{pick 4 seats in the back}
	\cdot \text{place rest (including empty seats)}$

	\noindent $\displaystyle({8 \choose 5}\cdot 5!) \cdot ({8 \choose 4} \cdot 4!) \cdot ({7 \choose 2} \cdot 5!) = 28,449,792,000$
