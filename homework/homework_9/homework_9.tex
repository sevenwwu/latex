\begin{document}

Prove the following propositions. Format your proof so each step of the proof is on its own line; each line should still be a complete sentence.\\

\begin{proposition}
	If $n\in\N$, then
	$$\frac{1}{2!}+\frac{2}{3!}+\frac{3}{4!}+\cdots+\frac{n}{(n+1)!} = 1 - \frac{1}{(n+1)!}.$$
	
\end{proposition}

\begin{problem}
	A chocolate bar consists of unit squares arranged in an $n\times m$ rectangular grid.
	You may split the bar into individual unit squares by breaking along the lines. What is the number of breaks required?
	Prove your answer is correct.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $n\in\N$ with $n\geq 2$, and let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ be sets.
	Let $B$ be a set.
	Then,
	$$B\cap(A_1\cup A_2\cup \cdots\cup A_n) = (B\cap A_1)\cup (B\cap A_2) \cup \cdots \cup (B\cap A_n).$$
