For these problems, you should justify your answers. You do not need to provide a rigorous mathematical proof, but rather an informal argument.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}
	Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Under what conditions do we have $A\times B = B\times A$?
		\item When is it true that $|\mathscr P(A)\times\mathscr P(A)| = |\mathscr P(A\times A)|$?
		\item What can you conclude if $A-B = \varnothing$?
		\item Describe in words the set $X=(A\times A)-D$, where the subset $D\subseteq A\times A$ is given by $D = \{(a,a)\,:\, a\in A\}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}
	Determine whether each of the following is true or false; justify your answer.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\R^2\subseteq\R^3$
		\item $A\times\varnothing = \varnothing$ for every set $A$.
		\item If $A\subseteq B$, then $\mathscr P(A)\subseteq\mathscr P(B)$.	
		\item If $\mathscr P(A)\subseteq\mathscr P(B)$, then $A\subseteq B$. 
	\end{enumerate}
